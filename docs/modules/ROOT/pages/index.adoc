= Quarkus AsyncAPI Extensions

There are two extensions:

The AsyncApi-Extension scans a given asyncapi-file 
and provides the infos found there as Microprofile-configuration (Kafka-topics, server-url, etc.). 
So it can be used by someone who has already an existing AsyncApi-Definition and wants to create a service according to it.

The AsyncApi-Scanner-Extension follows a "code first" approach. 
An annotation-scanner scans the existing code, combines it with the given mp-config and creates an AsyncApi-description with this infos.

You can find documentation for each of them in the navigation on the left.
